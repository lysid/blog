## Concepts

### Domain Driven Design (DDD)

- [Domain-Driven Design][ddd-book] by [Eric Evans][]: the reference book that first described the concepts behind DDD. Huge (500 pages).
- [Domain-Driven Design Quickly][ddd-book-summary]: a summary of the previous one (100 pages).
- [Implementing Domain-Driven Design][iddd-book] by [Vaughn Vernon][]: another reference book (600+ pages), updated with pratical advice for implementing DDD principles.
- [Domain-Driven Design Distilled][dddd-book] by [Vaughn Vernon][]: a practical introduction to the essential DDD concepts, with a lot of recommended practices to get started very quick. This is the perfect companion of the [Implementing Domain-Driven Design][iddd-book] book by the same author. I created a [summary][dddd-summary-pdf] PDF for a very quick read of the core concepts and best practices. *Although it is based on excerpts from the book, this really is my personal notebook and is not intended to disclose book contents. If this constitutes a problem for anyone, please contact me and I will immediately remove it from this blog.*
- The [DDD thread][sapiens-works-ddd] from the [Sapiens Works blog][] is also a valuable resource. He gives very clear explainations and examples for understanding the core DDD principles and advices to avoid common pitfalls.

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

- [Clarified CQRS](http://udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/) by [Udi Dahan][]: this is a very clear introduction on the motivations behind CQRS, the problems it helps solving and the terminology around it. A very good starting point to learning and understanding CQRS and related concepts.

### Event Sourcing (ES)

- The [Event Sourced Architectures for High Availability](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Event-Sourced-Architectures-for-High-Availability) keynote by [Martin Thompson][] during QCon London 2012. This was my first contact with event sourced architectures, but there may be more straightforward introductions as of now. 
- The [EventStore's introduction to Event Sourcing](http://docs.geteventstore.com/introduction/event-sourcing-basics/) from their official documentation: this is a very nice starting point to understanding EventSourcing concepts and motivations. It assumes that you know some concepts from CQRS and DDD, so expect to have to look sometimes to other reference material as needed.
