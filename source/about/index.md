>Â We are humans...

We are a small group of humans -- not super heros nor rock stars. We don't use superlatives when we speak about our products. 

We create software for real humans -- not for technological pride. We deeply care about how our products can actually help people in their daily lives. Technology is a mean and should remain as this.

Being small also means optimizing for less. Our software targets minimal technical requirements. We provide fair licensing (including free, open source parts) so that most people can benefit from our work.
